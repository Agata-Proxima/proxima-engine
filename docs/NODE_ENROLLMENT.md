# Proxima Engine node identity and enrollment

This guide describes how a Proxima Engine node receives a registered identity from a compatible control plane, redeems a one-time enrollment token, and persists its signing credential for later starts.

## Enrollment flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Admin as Organization admin
  participant Cloud as Agata Proxima Cloud
  participant Engine as Proxima Engine
  participant Store as Persistent node identity
  Admin->>Cloud: Authorize and register node
  Cloud-->>Admin: Node UUID + one-time enrollment token
  Admin->>Engine: Configure enrollment values
  Engine->>Cloud: Redeem token over HTTPS
  Cloud-->>Engine: Node identity and signing credential
  Engine->>Store: Persist node identity
  Engine->>Engine: Start with registered identity
```

The hosted product authorizes organizations and issues registration credentials. The public repository implements the Engine-side enrollment request, response validation, and local identity persistence.

## Local developer identity and hosted enrollment

For offline local development, use [Local developer mode](LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md). It generates a self-issued local node identity and signed test tenant tokens without a Cloud account.

For a hosted registered identity, a compatible Agata Proxima control plane issues a node UUID and a short-lived one-time enrollment token. A self-managed deployment can use its own compatible control plane.

## 1. Obtain enrollment values

Start at [agataproxima.com](https://agataproxima.com) and use the authorized organization workflow to register a node and obtain:

- The registered node UUID.
- The HTTPS enrollment URL ending in `/api/v1/nodes/enroll`.
- The one-time enrollment token.

Keep the token in a protected terminal or secret store. Do not paste it into GitHub, screenshots, chat, logs, or public documentation.

Use HTTPS for remote control-plane hosts. Loopback HTTP is reserved for local development.

## 2. Configure the Engine — PowerShell

Replace the placeholders with the values issued for the node:

```powershell
$env:PROXIMA_NODE_ID = "<node-uuid>"
$env:PROXIMA_NODE_ENROLLMENT_URL = "https://<control-plane-host>/api/v1/nodes/enroll"
$env:PROXIMA_NODE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN = "<one-time-token>"

$env:PROXIMA_LISTEN_ADDR = "127.0.0.1:6432"
$env:PROXIMA_UPSTREAM_ADDR = "127.0.0.1:5432"

cargo run -p proxima-engine
```

The Engine sends `POST /api/v1/nodes/enroll` with JSON fields `node_id` and `enrollment_token`. The control plane validates the one-time token and returns the node identity and signing credential. The Engine validates the response and persists the identity.

Remove the bootstrap token after enrollment:

```powershell
Remove-Item Env:PROXIMA_NODE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## 3. Configure the Engine — Bash

```bash
export PROXIMA_NODE_ID="<node-uuid>"
export PROXIMA_NODE_ENROLLMENT_URL="https://<control-plane-host>/api/v1/nodes/enroll"
export PROXIMA_NODE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN="<one-time-token>"
export PROXIMA_LISTEN_ADDR="127.0.0.1:6432"
export PROXIMA_UPSTREAM_ADDR="127.0.0.1:5432"
cargo run -p proxima-engine
unset PROXIMA_NODE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN
```

Set the values in the same process environment that starts the Engine. The Engine reads process environment variables; it does not automatically load a plain `.env` file.

## 4. Persist and protect the identity

Default identity paths:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AgataProxima\node-identity.json`, when `LOCALAPPDATA` exists.
- Other environments: `data/node-identity.json`.

Set `PROXIMA_NODE_IDENTITY_PATH` to choose another path. The identity file contains the node ID, organization ID, and a 32-byte signing credential. Restrict file permissions and include the file in protected backups.

The Engine reuses a valid saved identity on later starts, so the one-time enrollment token is needed only for the initial bootstrap. Use a separate identity path for each node.

## 5. Credential reference

| Variable or file | Purpose | Handling |
|---|---|---|
| `PROXIMA_NODE_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN` | One-time bootstrap credential | Short-lived; remove after enrollment |
| `PROXIMA_NODE_IDENTITY_PATH` | Persistent identity file | Contains a signing credential; protect it |
| `PROXIMA_NODE_SIGNING_KEY_HEX` | 32-byte node signing key, hex encoded | Normally loaded from saved identity; never commit |
| `PROXIMA_TENANT_SIGNING_KEY` | HMAC key for application-signed tenant context | Separate from node credentials; at least 32 bytes |
| `PROXIMA_ATTESTATION_INGEST_TOKEN` | Optional bearer credential for a compatible evidence receiver | Use the required `aga_` prefix; never commit |

These credentials serve different trust boundaries. Keep each in its designated configuration field and rotate it through the corresponding issuer.

## Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized:** verify that the node UUID and one-time token belong together and that the token is valid and unused.
- **Connection refused or timeout:** check DNS, routing, firewall rules, and the configured enrollment URL.
- **TLS certificate error:** use the correct HTTPS hostname and a trusted certificate chain.
- **Identity file error:** check the path, JSON format, and read/write permissions.
- **Engine exits before listening:** inspect the startup error and verify all supplied enrollment values.
